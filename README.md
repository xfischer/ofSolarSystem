ofSolarSystem
==============

Work in progress

Solar system navigator made with OpenFrameworks.
Relative planet sizes and rotation speeds are accurate.

Two vizualization modes:
- SIZE mode ( 's' key) : Planets are drawn one next to another, thus it's easy to see how different in size they are
- DISTANCE mode ( 'd' key) : Planets are drawn at real distances. Hard to navigate and still not good to realize how far they really are.

3 camera types ( 'c' key) :
- ofEasyCam: rotate around Sun
- SphereCam: GOOD one. Navigate with 'space' key through all celestial bodies
- FreeCam: navigate with mouse. Left button : rotate, middle button: move left/right, right button: move forward/backwards
